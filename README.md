# Ultra-Mega-PowerSupply 

This is a Open Source Power Supply.

### Why do we need a Open Source Power Supply?
One night, I was bored in front of my computer debugging a product that I was developing and I fought, why not develop a Open Source Power Supply just for fun?
So I started searching around the internet for a programmed open source Power Supply and didn't find anything (we find but it's more fun to make yourself one nice piece of lab equipment.)

### What is the specs of this Power Supply?	
- 0-30v - 0-3A

### Nice features?
- Programmable Shutdown Current	
- Programmable Voltage and Current Curves
